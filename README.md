# Flappy-Bird-game

I have developed a Flappy Bird game using three core web technologies:
*HTML* to structure the game and create the canvas where the game runs.
*CSS* to style the game, set the background, and ensure the layout is responsive.
*JavaScript* to handle game logic, control the bird's movement, detect collisions, manage scoring, and make the game interactive and responsive on different devices.
